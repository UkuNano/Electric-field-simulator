# Electric-field-simulator

A simple program that lets you place electric charges and formations of electric charges (meshes) in a 2D grid and calculates the electric field and electric field lines. It just uses the Coulomb's law to calculate the field strength at a point. The formula E = k * q / r^2 is used to calculate the field strength vector for a single charge at a single point and then all the vectors are added together to get the field strength vector for a single point.

Made in C using Raylib 4.2. Developed with the Tiny C Complier.
